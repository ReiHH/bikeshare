### Project Title
Explore US Bikeshare Data (as part of the Udacity Programming for Data Science with Python Nanodegree Program)

### Description
Over the past decade, bicycle-sharing systems have been growing in number and popularity in cities across the world. Bicycle-sharing systems allow users to rent bicycles on a very short-term basis for a price. This allows people to borrow a bike from point A and return it at point B, though they can also return it to the same location if they'd like to just go for a ride. Regardless, each bike can serve several users per day.

In this project various statistics are computed to analyze popular times of travel, popular stations and trips, user info etc.

In this project, data provided by Motivate (https://www.motivateco.com/) was used, a bike share system provider for many major cities in the United States. The system usage is compared to uncover bike share usage patterns between three large cities: Chicago, New York City, and Washington, DC.

The Datasets

Randomly selected data for the first six months of 2017 are provided for all three cities. All three of the data files contain the same core six (6) columns:

    Start Time (e.g., 2017-01-01 00:07:57)
    End Time (e.g., 2017-01-01 00:20:53)
    Trip Duration (in seconds - e.g., 776)
    Start Station (e.g., Broadway & Barry Ave)
    End Station (e.g., Sedgwick St & North Ave)
    User Type (Subscriber or Customer)

The Chicago and New York City files also have the following two columns:

    Gender
    Birth Year

### Files used

    chicago.csv
    new_york_city.csv
    washington.csv

### Credits

I found the tutorials of https://www.w3schools.com on python and pandas very helpful.

The website https://www.toptal.com/developers/gitignore is very helpful with creating an operating system specific .gitignore file and was used to ignore windows specific files that may be generated by the operating system.
